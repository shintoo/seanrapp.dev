        Remember when the rumors of the 3DS came out, a million moons ago?
      </p>
      <p>
        My friend
        Josh in middle school band told me that <i>it would have 3D without glasses.
        </i> I had no idea how the flip that would work, and all my 12-year old
        brain could imagine was a cube with screens on all sides, which makes absolutely
        zero (0) sense. Either way, it sounded like the coolest, of-course-Nintendo-would-do-something-so-crazy,
        but-no-way-that-rumor-is-true-because-how-would-that-even-work thing I had ever heard. And hilariously enough,
        for
        as hyped as I was for it,
        I dropped Pokemon before the 3DS actually came out and didn't end up getting one
        until 5 years later (~2015). I am one of the lucky ones that can play with the 3D
        slider all the way up all day and not get any kind of headache or whatever.
        I mostly played MK7 (mario kart seven (7)), 3D Land, and a bit of Omega Ruby.

      </div>
      <p>
        The 3DS uses a thing called a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_barrier">
          parallax barrier</a> to block the pixels intended for the
        left eye from the right eye's view and vice versa, which works wonderfully (for most),
        but what if you wanted to view 3D on your usual phone/computer screen? Or make your own
        3D image? This is completely doable with techniques such as <i>parallel view</i> and <i>
          cross view</i>. Instead of looking at one place in 3D space where two interlaced images
        are displayed (a la 3DS via parallax barrier), we can use our eyes in such a way that
        they are looking at two different images, in two different places on our screen. A normal
        screen with no 3D specific technology. When using the parallel view technique, this means
        your right eye will look at an image on the right, and your left eye will look at an image
        on the left. Likewise with cross view, your right eye will look at an image on the left,
        and your left eye will look at an image on the right. (I like parallel view better, far less
        strain on the eyes, but sometimes cross view is more crisp. You can always convert the image
        from one to the other by swapping them). The result is that the two images converge into one
        when your brain reconciles the two different views of each eye, and actual physical depth is
        perceived, as if you were peering into a real 3D scene.

        <div class="focus-block">
          When using something like a ViewMaster, a 3DS, a VR headset, or even 2D glasses, your eyes are forced
          to see only the image intended for that particular eye. With the parallel view or
          cross view, you are manually directing each eye to the intended image.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The images can be taken with a camera
        at two different locations, or ideally, two identical cameras next to each other taking a photo
        at the same time. Also very fun is 3D art rather than photos (whether making two 2D drawings with
        different perspectives, or creating a 3D model/scene and rendering it twice with the camera in two
        different places.)

      </div>

      <p>
        The above pair of images are from a 3DS screenshot of Animal Crossing, with the left eye's image
        on the left, and the right eye's image on the right. With parallel view, the balloon should very
        much so stand out from the rest of the image, being quite farther into the foreground than the player.
        All of the elements in the image in fact should have a perceivable distance to them, the closest being
        the balloon of course, then the tree planter, player, and the background plants. Even the ground should
        have a sense of depth as it moves further into the distance.
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        Above is a pair of images from the Perseverance rover on Mars, taken with a pair of cameras
        called <a target="_blank" href="../static/img/mastcam-z.png">MASTCAM-Z</a>. While the average adult pupillary
        distance is
        about 63mm (2.5in), the
        distance between the two cameras of MASTCAM-Z is
        <a target="_blank"
          href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70218464#:~:text=The%20two%20Mastcam-Z%20cameras%20are%20mounted%20with,stereo%20baseline">
          24.4cm (9.6in)</a>, so the perspective shift between the two images is not quite what your
        eyes would see if you were looking at this rock irl.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do the parallel view technique, your eyes should not be converging on your screen, but some
        distance past the screen. The two dots above each of the images should converge to a
        single dot above a 3D image. It does take practice to get this down, but if you're having
        trouble you can try:

      <ul>
        <li>Look at something far away, off to the side from your screen. Then, shift your eyes back to the
          screen <i>without</i>
          <button class="tooltip" onclick="openModal('focus-modal')">refocusing</button>
          <div id="focus-modal" class="modal">
            <div class="modal-content">
              <p>
                While I say "without refocusing", I really mean without reconverging
                your eyes such that the line of sight for each intersects at your screen. <i>Focusing</i>
                your eye is done by muscles inside your eye that stretch and relax the lens behind your
                pupil; aiming your eyes is done of course with muscles outside of your eye. You can be focused
                at, for example, 1 foot, while the lines of sight for your eyes simultaneously converging at 2 feet.
              </p>
              <button class="button" onclick="closeModal('focus-modal')">
                <div class="check">&#10004;</div>
                OK
              </button>
            </div>
          </div>
          on the screen
        </li>
        <li>If you're using a phone/small laptop/etc, move the screen out of the way and look at something far.
          Then, without refocusing your eyes, move your screen back in front of you.</li>
        <li>If your screen is relatively glossy, try looking at your reflection in the screen instead of at
          the screen itself.</li>
      </ul>

      A nice how-to guide for both parallel and cross view is also available on Takashi Sekitani's site,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stereoeye.jp/howto/">here</a>
      (<a href="https://www.stereoeye.jp/howto/index_e.html">eng</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can kindasorta get the effect by making an alternating gif of the two perspectives, but of course this
        isn't the same as actually perceiving the depth with your eyes like in an irl scenario, but it is still neat:
      </p>

      <div class="imgc">
        <img style="width: 30%" src="../static/img/mars-rock.gif" /> <br />
      </div>

      <p>
        If you like Mars images, there are tons of stereographic image pairs from MASTCAM-Z, though they are not quite
        curated in such a way that it is easy to find them. You can hunt for them on
        <a target="_blank"
          href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw-images/?order=sol+desc%2Cinstrument_sort+asc%2Csample_type_sort+asc%2C+date_taken+desc&per_page=50&page=0&mission=msl&af=MAST_LEFT%7CMAST_RIGHT%2C%2C">
          images.nasa.gov</a>, but Daniel Pomar√®de (the cosmologist) often finds and posts neat stereo pairs
        on his <a target="_blank" href="https://mastodon.social/@pomarede/113551615758758726">social media</a>. The
        astrophotographer
        J-P Metsavainio also has a large collection of stereoscopic works, where original 2D captures
        of various deep space objects have been artistically rendered stereoscopic based on available data,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://astroanarchy.blogspot.com/search/label/stereo%20images">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond specifically space-related images, there is so much to find out there, even
        <a target="_blank" href="https://reddit.com/r/parallelview">parallel</a> and <a target="_blank"
          href="https://reddit.com/r/crossview">cross</a>
        view subreddits, with various examples.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also great fun is trying your hand at making original stereographic images, whether that be by throwing
        something together in your favorite image editor&trade; or using something like Blender to render to images.
