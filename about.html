      Hullo, I am Sean.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>animals (esp birds for their accessibly apparent diversity),</li>
      <li>TRAINS,</li>
      <li>Japanese language (esp kanji paleography),</li>
      <li>space/astronomy (fictional (ds9 and recently SGA), and real
        (orion/sls, iss, hst, jwst)),</li>
      <li>music (I play drums/piano/guitar/ukulele to varying degrees of skill level
        (mostly not good)) (but also just really like listening to music),</li>
      <li>and video games :~)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I am a software engineer at the <a target="_blank" href="https://stsci.edu">Space Telescope Science Institute</a>,
      supporting all 3 (yes we have <a href="https://stsci.edu/roman">another
        one comin</a>) telescopes, doing data API and web UI
      stuff for astronomers and science data processing pipelines. I also serve as a chair of <a target="_blank"
        href="https://sjastudy.org" a>Study Japanese in Arlington</a>, a local non-profit advocating for Japanese
      language study and holding all sorts of events in our community :D
    </p>
    <p>
      Before all that, I lived in Florida and did launch simulation software in the Launch Control Center at Kennedy
      Space Center for NASA's Artemis Program, working on <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-i/">Artemis
        I</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/">Artemis II</a>. Making spaceship
      was very fun.

      Idk what I am going to use this site for tbh, I have started and abandoned several blogs/etc over the years, and
      seeing as I have zero (0) plans to look for a new job any time soon, I don't need to waste this domain on what was
      basically a resume. Plus I like to write little blogs and stuff every now and then, so this can be a place for
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think having a place to put my thoughts, use up some halfcreative
      energy, and have something to show for it will do wonders for how I spend
      my time. ty for coming
